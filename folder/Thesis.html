        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Although a considerable number of problems whose analysis depends on a set of
          complex mathematical relations exist in the literature due to recent developments in the
          field of decision making, still very simplified and unrealistic assumptions are involved in
          many. Simulation is one of the most powerful tools to deal with this kind of problems
          and enjoys being free of any restricting assumptions which may generally be
          considered in a stochastic system. In addition, simulation optimization techniques are
          categorized into two broad classes of model-based and meta-model-based methods.
          In the first class, simulation and optimization component interact with each other
          causing an increase in simulation times and costs. To cope with this problem, a third
          component defined as a meta-model that estimates the relationships between the
          inputs and outputs of the system being simulated comes to the picture in the second
          class problems. Besides, optimization of semi-expensive simulation optimization
          problems needs a numerous simulation run in model-based methods. However, as the
          validation cost increases at a rapid rate in each iteration of the meta-model-based
          methods, a new method which consists of two phases has been introduced in the
          literature to solve semi-expensive simulation optimization problems in less
          computational time. In the first phase, similar to a model-based algorithm, the
          simulation output is used directly in the optimization stage. In the second phase, the
          simulation model is changed with a validated meta-model. In this paper, an artificial
          neural network is employed as the meta-model in order to compare its performance to
          the ones of the original algorithm that uses a Kriging meta-model in five popular test
          problems as well as an (s, S) inventory problem.</p>
